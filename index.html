        <p class="lead">
            Boulder Insurance Group was founded to give clear, honest personal insurance consulting.
            Our emphasis on individual and group health insurance makes navigating the various choices easier.
            The whole process starts with a personal interview to discover your own individual insurance needs.
            Information is gathered about things like your current insurance, budget, deductible tolerance,
            and what plans your doctor accepts.
            Hospital choice can be an important factor; some health insurance plans only work with certain hospitals.
            We are independent insurance agents that work for our clients to find the best solutions to their
            individual needs.  The best part is, the companies pay us, not our customers.
            </p>
            <p>
            We take pride in our ability to bring the same objective viewpoint to
            serving our customers life insurance, long term care insurance, medicare supplement insurance,
            and tax advantaged retirement planning needs. We have the ability to compare insurance plans with you
            so that you receive the right coverage for your lifestyle and situation.

            <h2>How to make your money grow / Safe Money</h2>
            <p>
            One of the best books I have read lately is “The Last Chance Millionaire” by Douglas Andrews.
            The website is at <a href="http://www.missedfortune.com">www.missedfortune.com</a>.
            Since I am a little nutty about financial strategies,
            this was a book I couldn’t put down. I started reading it because a friend had sent it to me in the mail.
            I was obligated to at least read the first paragraph. That happened on a Friday afternoon during the
            busiest month of my career so far. Despite looming deadlines and meetings to prepare for, I finished the
            whole thing by Monday morning. One of my clients later said to me “oh yeah, I got that quote you sent me
            at 1:00 in the morning, what were you doing up so late?” My website developer asked "why haven't you
            finished those articles yet?"  That’s how good it was.
            </p>
            <p>
                Last week I was at a training seminar in Phoenix for one of my favorite (most stable) companies,
                and got back exhausted and wanting to be with my family. Another book had arrived, this time from
                somebody else. It was Called “Tax-Free Retirement” by Patrick Kelly see
                <a href="http://www.taxfreebook.com">www.taxfreebook.com</a>.
                My quality family time for the last three days was with me reading in the living room while
                my son played on the floor with Lego’s, and my wife watched TV.
            </p>
            <p>
                After meeting with an associate Friday to cover some investment strategies, I mentioned these books
                to my friend. His response was “oh yeah that whole infinite banking concept is really starting to pick
                up steam.” My next book to read will be based on his suggestion
                “Becoming Your Own Banker,” by Nelson Nash.
            </p>
            <p>
                These are all based on concepts I have been studying for the last two years.
                My biggest question is why don’t more people know about this? I’ll get back to that later.
                One website that caught my interest early on was
                <a href="http://www.fleewallstreet.com">www.fleewallstreet.com</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The story from my childhood that has always stuck with me was the one about my god parents.
                They started out their family on the same block as my parents in a house that cost $18,000.
                From these meager beginnings, Mr. G became quite wealthy. They lived in a mansion on a vast estate.
                Well at least it was bigger than our whole neighborhood. They had a pool that we swam in a lot growing up.
                They had several horses too. I would get presents from Mrs. G on my birthday from exotic places like
                Hawaii and Spain. Then something happened. Something Changed.
                The pool got filled in, and the horses were gone. Their property got smaller and smaller.
                Eventually they moved to a smaller house, then into a duplex.

            <h2>Tax Deferral Example</h2>
            <p>
                If you take a dollar and double it, you will have 2 dollars.
                If you do this 20 times, you will have $1,000,000.
                Lets see how tax deferral can affect this exercise.
            </p>
            <h4>Examples</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Invest in a tax deferred strategy, and pay a 33% tax at the end.
                    That leaves $702,545.92.
                </li>
                <li>
                    we pay the 33% tax each time we double the money.  After doubling the original
                    dollar 20 times and paying taxes each time it doubles, there is only $28,466.20.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                email me at mjdeyoung@msn.com to find out how you can take advantage of tax deferred
                strategies (you can just opt in as soon as we figure out how to do that)
