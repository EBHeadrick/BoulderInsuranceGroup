            The whole process starts with a personal interview to discover your own individual insurance needs.

            and what plans your doctor accepts.
            Hospital choice can be an important factor; some health insurance plans only work with certain hospitals.
            We are independent insurance agents that work for our clients to find the best solutions to their
            individual needs.  The best part is, the companies pay us, not our customers.

            <p>
            One of the best books I have read lately is “The Last Chance Millionaire” by Douglas Andrews.
            The website is at <a href="http://www.missedfortune.com">www.missedfortune.com</a>.
            Since I am a little nutty about financial strategies,
            this was a book I couldn’t put down. I started reading it because a friend had sent it to me in the mail.
            I was obligated to at least read the first paragraph. That happened on a Friday afternoon during the
            busiest month of my career so far. Despite looming deadlines and meetings to prepare for, I finished the
            whole thing by Monday morning. One of my clients later said to me “oh yeah, I got that quote you sent me
            at 1:00 in the morning, what were you doing up so late?” My website developer asked "why haven't you
            finished those articles yet?"  That’s how good it was.
            </p>
            <p>
                Last week I was at a training seminar in Phoenix for one of my favorite (most stable) companies,
                and got back exhausted and wanting to be with my family. Another book had arrived, this time from
                somebody else. It was Called “Tax-Free Retirement” by Patrick Kelly see
                <a href="http://www.taxfreebook.com">www.taxfreebook.com</a>.
                My quality family time for the last three days was with me reading in the living room while
                my son played on the floor with Lego’s, and my wife watched TV.
            </p>
            <p>
                After meeting with an associate Friday to cover some investment strategies, I mentioned these books
                to my friend. His response was “oh yeah that whole infinite banking concept is really starting to pick
                up steam.” My next book to read will be based on his suggestion
                “Becoming Your Own Banker,” by Nelson Nash.
            </p>
            <p>
                These are all based on concepts I have been studying for the last two years.
                My biggest question is why don’t more people know about this? I’ll get back to that later.
                One website that caught my interest early on was
                <a href="http://www.fleewallstreet.com">www.fleewallstreet.com</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The story from my childhood that has always stuck with me was the one about my god parents.
                They started out their family on the same block as my parents in a house that cost $18,000.
                From these meager beginnings, Mr. G became quite wealthy. They lived in a mansion on a vast estate.
                Well at least it was bigger than our whole neighborhood. They had a pool that we swam in a lot growing up.
                They had several horses too. I would get presents from Mrs. G on my birthday from exotic places like
                Hawaii and Spain. Then something happened. Something Changed.
                The pool got filled in, and the horses were gone. Their property got smaller and smaller.
                Eventually they moved to a smaller house, then into a duplex.

            <h2>Tax Deferral Example</h2>
            <p>
                If you take a dollar and double it, you will have 2 dollars.
                If you do this 20 times, you will have $1,000,000.
                Lets see how tax deferral can affect this exercise.
            </p>
            <h4>Examples</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Invest in a tax deferred strategy, and pay a 33% tax at the end.
                    That leaves $702,545.92.
                </li>
                <li>
                    we pay the 33% tax each time we double the money.  After doubling the original
                    dollar 20 times and paying taxes each time it doubles, there is only $28,466.20.
                </li>

                    Individual Health Insurance plans are usually less expensive than group plans.
                    They are also the harder to qualify for but these plans are fully underwritten.
                    That means the insurance company scrutinizes the applicants health history to make sure they
                    are an acceptable risk.  This is the reason it is usually less expensive, the insurance company
                    knows what kind of risk they are taking on you.
                    If you have a major claim in the future, your premiums typically rise.

                    You may be self-employed or your employer might not offer health benefits.
                    If these cases, an individual health insurance plan might offer you the protection and
                    coverage you need. Contact one of our representatives at Boulder Insurance Group and we will
                    review your specific needs and situation and then compare the many different health insurance
                    options available to find the right fit for you.

                <h2>Medicare</h2>
                <p>
                    Medicare is a form of insurance available to people 65 and over, as well as people that are disabled.
                    Boulder Insurance Group has specialized in helping qualified individuals secure medicare insurance for
                    many years.  Medicare consists of two parts: A and B. Everyone is entitled to part A, which covers
                    hospital costs.  Most people qualify for part B because they worked and paid taxes.
                    There is a charge for part B, and it changes from year to year.
                    Part B covers doctor office visits, and medical tests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The basic costs of health care are covered at 80% by medicare, however Dental, Vision, and
                    Hearing are not covered.  Most people get supplemental insurance to cover the additional cost.
                    If you qualify for Medicare but would like to further protect yourself with additional coverage,
                    Boulder Insurance Group can help you choose the plans that best fulfill your needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In recent years, Part C (medicare advantage), and part D (prescription drugs) have been added.

                <h3>Medicare Advantage Plans</h3>
                <p>
                    The Medicare Advantage Plan for prescription drugs actually takes over as the primary insurance
                    from medicare.  This means medicare pays the plan (insurance company) to administer your health
                    plans.  Doctors and hospitals must have an agreement with your plan in order to get compensated.
                </p><p>
                Emergencies are always covered, but need authorization from the insurance company as soon as possible.
                The Medicare Advantage Plan also includes coverage for prescription drugs (part D).  Many of these
                plans offer additional services like silver sneakers, and wellness counseling.
            </p><p>
                The Medicare Advantage Plan for HMO's:
            </p><p>
                The Medicare Advantage Plan for HMO's (Part C plans) take the place of Medicare Part A and Medicare
                Part B and may offer more benefits than Original Medicare.  Medicare pays your Medicare Advantage
                Plan monthly to provide you with hospital and medical coverage.  Original Medicare will pay for
                hospice care and some costs for clinical trials.
            </p><p>
                Medicare Advantage Plan Enrollment:
            </p><p>
                To enroll in Medicare Advantage Plan, you must be enrolled in both Parts A and B.
                You, Medicaid, or another third party must continue to pay your Part B premium.
                Another benefit of a Medicare Advantage Plan with Part D coverage is that you only need one
                Identification card for your hospital, medical, and pharmacy benefits.
            </p><p>
                Medicare Advantage Plans are designed to help you find the right plan at the right price for
                your own specific needs.  They offer you protection from unexpected medical expenses,
                with premiums as low as $0.
            </p><p>
                A Medicare Advantage Plan may often use an HMO (Health Maintenance Organization) provider network.
                You will have to receive care from an in-network PCP (Primary Care Physician), or other in-network
                specialist, in order to receive benefits.  You may choose your own PCP from a large selection of PCPs statewide.
            </p><p>
                Keeping the same PCP works best for your care because he or she gets to know you and your health needs when you go in for routine visits and checkups.  Your PCP also maintains a record of your medical history.
            </p><p>
                When you need specialty care, you can count on your PCP to refer you to the right specialists.  The concept of a PCP is central to all HMO plans; however, you can change your PCP at any time for any reason by simply calling the plan provider.
            </p><p>
                If you need emergency or urgent care services, you may go to the nearest health care professional that can help you.  Emergency and urgent care services are covered at the in network rates no matter whether they were received from in-network or out-of network providers.
            </p><p>
                Your Medicare Advantage Plan will have a few enrollment periods you should know about.
            </p><p>
                The Initial Enrollment Period is for the 7 months surrounding your Medicare eligibility: This is the 3 months before you turn 65, the month when you turn 65, and the 3 months after you turn 65.
            </p><p>
                The Annual Election Period usually runs from November 15 to December 31st each year (these dates will change for 2011).  This is the period you can enroll in or change your Medicare Advantage Plan. You may also switch to Original Medicare during the AEP.
            </p><p>
                New coverage begins on January 1st. The Annual Dis-enrollment Period is from January 1 to February 14.  You may dis-enroll from your Medicare Advantage Plan.
            </p><p>
                During this time, you will be enrolled in Original Medicare and will have the option of choosing a stand-alone prescription drug plan.  The Special Enrollment Period varies based on each person's situation.

                depending on the plan you choose.

        <h1>Long Term Care</h1>
        <p>
        Long Term Care is Chronic Care.  Chronic Care can be defined as Care given over a long time period without
        the expectation of the patient returning to good health.
        </p>
        <p>
        Long Term Care can include services that are medical and non-medical in nature, and provide for the health
        and well being of the patient.  Often, Long Term Care does not require skilled medical professionals;
        it begins at home with assistance provided by family members, neighbors, or friends.  Loved ones acting as
        caregivers deliver Custodial Care, which includes transportation, shopping, managing finances, and help with
        the 6 activities of daily living.  These activities of daily living are clearly defined in the medical, and
        insurance community;  They are eating, bathing dressing, toileting, continence, and transferring
        (eg. Moving from bed to a chair).  Sometimes a patient will require constant observation and assistance for dementia.
        </p>
        <p>
        Long Term Care can be provided in a variety of settings:
        <ul>

                <li>Hospice Facilities</li>
            </ul>
        are the most common places
        to receive care.  Because Long Term Care usually does not require the assistance of skilled medical
        professionals, it is usually not covered by health insurance or by Medicare.
        </p>
        <p>
        Most Long Term Care is financed by private funds (self-insurance), Medicaid, or by Long Term Care Insurance.

        <h1>Life Insurance</h1>
        <p>
        Life Insurance is the one kind of insurance that will always be used.
        There are many variables to consider when this kind of product, for it can be used as a protection and
        source of stability in today's unpredictable world.  For children, life insurance can be a way that
        parents or grandparents set up a fund that can be used tax-free later in life for education, or for major
        purchases.  During young adulthood it can be used to provide a spouse with income in case of premature
        death. In middle age, it can be used to protect a spouse, children, or to pay off a mortgage.
        In old age, life insurance can be used to provide for final expenses.  What many people don't realize
        is that life insurance can be used to fund a retirement with tax free income.  Life insurance has many
        benefits for the living too!  One thing important to understand is that the younger you are when you start
        a life insurance policy, the less it will cost.
        </p><p>
        At Boulder Insurance Group, we specialize in helping our
        clients to secure policies that cover them throughout the major events in their lives, giving them the
        answers and peace of mind that they seek when planning for the future.
        </p>

        <div id="term">
        <h2>Term</h2>
        <p>Term Life Insurance costs less than whole life insurance, but does not build cash value.
        It lasts for a specific number of years, or term.  Usually the term is 10, 20, or 30 years.
        The cost is based on age at issue, and stays the same thru out the term.  Some term policies can be
        converted to whole life without evidence of insurability.  This is an excellent way to start out with
        the coverage amount you need, and convert to whole life as your financial situation improves.
        </p><p>
        At Boulder Insurance Group, our expert consultants know how to help you best structure your life insurance
        policies to maximize your security and benefit.

        <div id="whole">
        <h2>Whole</h2>
        <p>Whole Life Insurance is for your whole life.  The cost is determined based on your age when the policy is
        issued, and it lasts until the end of your life.  Some policies are paid up in one lump sum, some have
        premiums for 10 or 20 years, and some are paid up at age 65.  Whole life policies build cash value that can
        be used later. Money can be surrendered, or taken out as a loan, but be careful!  If money is not drawn out
        properly, it can be a taxable event, or even cause the policy to lapse prematurely.

        <h1>Disability Insurance</h1>
        <p>
        Disability Insurance is the foundation of any financial plan.  It protects the source of funding for
        all of the other planning.  Despite the importance of Disability Insurance, it is the most commonly
        overlooked component of a protection strategy.  A person in their 40's is almost twice as likely to
        lose income for 90 days or more due to a disability, than they are to lose income due to premature death.
        </p>
        <p>
        Boulder Insurance Group is dedicated to helping our customers choose the correct mix of coverages and
        plans for their present and future needs. No one plans to utilize a disability insurance policy,

            <h2>Long Term Disability Insurance</h2>
            <p>
                Long Term Disability Insurance is intended to replace income during an extended illness, or
                rehabilitation. None of us expect to become seriously injured. In fact, like Life Insurance,
                people often overlook securing disability coverage because they just don't want to deal with the
                unpleasant thought of needing to use it. However, having protection against the unexpected can
                prevent hassles, skyrocketing medical bills, and heartache during a time of crisis.
                At Boulder Insurance Group, we believe that worrying about medical expenses and lost in come s
                hould be the last thing on your mind when you're recovering from a long-term illness or injury.
                We can work with you to set up a plan that will bring peace of mind you need to restore your health

            </p>
            <p>
                Long term disability insurance has a longer elimination period than short term disability insurance,
                usually 90 or 180 days.  The policies can last for 2 years or more, even until age 65.

            In the event of an unexpected accident, you might find yourself unable to work for a short period
            of time. If you do not have enough paid leave from work, you might experience an interruption in
            your income. Short Term Disability Insurance is designed to fill in the gaps while you recover.
            </p><p>
            After a short elimination period, usually 3 days, the policy will begin to pay a daily benefit
            directly to the individual.  This money can then be used to pay bills that would normally be paid
            from the lost income. Click here to find out how to avoid paying taxes on this income.

        <p>Vision Insurance helps pay the cost of glasses and contact lenses. Vision plans are great for people who
            are self-employed or working for an employer who does not provide vision coverage. Even if you have
            perfect vision, it is important to make visits to an ophthalmologist on a routine basis to ensure long
            term vision health. Under most plans, an annual eye exam is available with a small co-payment once a year.
            Typical plans also provide an allowance for contact lenses, frames and lenses.
            Most policies allow for a new pair of glasses every 24 months and can be purchased at very affordable rates.

            If you are in need of vision insurance coverage, Boulder Insurance group can help you compare insurance

            Dental Insurance is another important coverage that is included in
            some employer-paid insurance programs, but not all. While routine cleanings may be affordable, the cost of

    <div id="estate">
        <h1>Estate Planning</h1>
        <p>
            Estate planning includes wills, directives, and trusts. The basic concept is to maximize the money that goes to your family or favorite charity, and to ensure that your final wishes are carried out. You should seek the help of a legal professional before taking any action on the legal issues involved in estate planning.  Boulder Insurance Group does not give legal advice, but encourages all of our customers to engage in at least minimal estate planning activities. To this end, we have provided some more detail below. The following is for informational purposes, to support our valued customers: Estate Planning - Wills A will is a legal document that determines the succession of your estate. Without a will, the state will distribute the entire estate according to predetermined rules. In other words, your final wishes may not be carried out the way you desire unless your estate planning documents contain a will.  For families with small children, your will is to provide for your children in the event of your premature death. In addition to providing for their care and upbringing, the guardian will have control of the proceeds from any life insurance policies until they reach maturity. This is a very broad comment on the very complicated subject of estate planning so please seek legal counsel.   In general life insurance companies will not distribute life insurance proceeds to a minor. Estate Planning - Directives Directives are a critical part of estate planning if you want to have your wishes carried out, and not put tremendous decision making burdens on your loved ones. Directives cover issues like Do Not Resuscitate Orders, medical and financial Power of Attorney, and final wishes.  This part of Estate Planning allows a person to name someone to act on their behalf in financial or medical situations when they are not able to do so themselves. Estate Planning is the process of helping people ensure that their assets are distributed according to their wishes. In the case of a complex estate, complex planning can be used to minimize the amount of estate tax due upon the person’s death. Boulder Insurance Group’s estate planning experts can help you navigate this complex issue and choose the most relevant structure for you. We’re also able to work directly with your financial advisor, attorney and/or accountant to meet your estate planning needs.

    <div id="living">
        <h1>Living Trusts</h1>
        <p>
            Trusts are an arrangement where real or personal property is held by a trustee for the benefit of another person (the beneficiary). There are two basic kinds of trusts; testamentary trusts are formed at your death and a living trust is established during your lifetime.  In a funded living trust, the settlor puts money and property into their trust during their lifetime for their own benefit, and possibly for the benefit of others. When a person is capable of managing their own affairs, they usually name themselves as trustee of the living trust they establish.  The duties of the trustee are to invest and distribute the assets of the trust to the settlor and beneficiaries.   Choosing a Revocable or Irrevocable Living Trust.  Living trusts are almost always revocable, which means the settlor can revoke or amend the trust as long as they live, or as long as they are capable of managing their own affairs. Alternate trustees can be named to take over the trustee duties if the settlor becomes disabled or unable to perform their duties.   When the settlor dies, the living trust usually terminates, and the successor trustee distributes the trust property to the beneficiaries, similar to the distribution from a will.  Often times, a living trust will continue after the death of the settlor in order to provide benefits to the settlor’s spouse and family.  The living trust will then terminate at a later date.  If a living trust is set up properly, and fully funded (all of the settlor’s assets are put into the trust), there can be several advantages. A fully funded living trust can eliminate the need for probate upon the death of the settlor. If a settlor owns property in multiple states, it can possibly eliminate the need for probate in multiple states.   A living trust may eliminate the need for conservatorship if the settlor becomes disabled or unable to fulfill the duties of trustee. However, a separate medical power of attorney is needed in order to make medical decisions for the settlor.  The terms of a living trust are generally private whereas the terms of a will are public.  Your Living Trust and Taxes:  If a living trust is not drafted correctly, there can be significant harmful tax liabilities. It’s usually better to have professional assistance in drafting either a testamentary or living trust instead of trying to do it yourself, or by purchasing a preprinted trust form.  It’s best for you to keep an up to date list of all your property and debts.  Things to include are insurance policies, securities, bank accounts, real estate, artwork, jewelry, business interests, pension plans, IRA’s, and other retirement benefits. You should keep this list with your other important documents.  It’s best to keep a list of your current financial advisors, your attorney, and your accountant in a safe, easy to find place also. There are many variables to weigh in the creation of a living trust so professional help is a must to be sure your wishes are honored. At Boulder Insurance Group we work with you, your attorney and/or financial planner to customize a testamentary or living trust specifically for you.
