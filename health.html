        <h2>Individual</h2>
        <p>
            Individual Health Insurance plans are usually less expensive than group plans.
            They are also the harder to qualify for but these plans are fully underwritten.
            That means the insurance company scrutinizes the applicants health history to make sure they
            are an acceptable risk.  This is the reason it is usually less expensive, the insurance company
            knows what kind of risk they are taking on you.
            If you have a major claim in the future, your premiums typically rise.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may be self-employed or your employer might not offer health benefits.

        coverage you need. Contact one of our representatives at Boulder Insurance Group and we will

        <h2>Medicare</h2>
        <p>
            Medicare is a form of insurance available to people 65 and over, as well as people that are disabled.
            Boulder Insurance Group has specialized in helping qualified individuals secure medicare insurance for
            many years.  Medicare consists of two parts: A and B. Everyone is entitled to part A, which covers
            hospital costs.  Most people qualify for part B because they worked and paid taxes.
            There is a charge for part B, and it changes from year to year.
            Part B covers doctor office visits, and medical tests.
        </p>
        <p>
            The basic costs of health care are covered at 80% by medicare, however Dental, Vision, and
            Hearing are not covered.  Most people get supplemental insurance to cover the additional cost.
            If you qualify for Medicare but would like to further protect yourself with additional coverage,
            Boulder Insurance Group can help you choose the plans that best fulfill your needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            In recent years, Part C (medicare advantage), and part D (prescription drugs) have been added.

        <h3>Medicare Advantage Plans</h3>
        <p>
            The Medicare Advantage Plan for prescription drugs actually takes over as the primary insurance from medicare.  This means medicare pays the plan (insurance company) to administer your health plans.  Doctors and hospitals must have an agreement with your plan in order to get compensated.
        </p><p>
            Emergencies are always covered, but need authorization from the insurance company as soon as possible.  The Medicare Advantage Plan also includes coverage for prescription drugs (part D).  Many of these plans offer additional services like silver sneakers, and wellness counseling.
    </p><p>
            The Medicare Advantage Plan for HMO's:
    </p><p>
            The Medicare Advantage Plan for HMO's (Part C plans) take the place of Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B and may offer more benefits than Original Medicare.  Medicare pays your Medicare Advantage Plan monthly to provide you with hospital and medical coverage.  Original Medicare will pay for hospice care and some costs for clinical trials.
    </p><p>
            Medicare Advantage Plan Enrollment:
    </p><p>
            To enroll in Medicare Advantage Plan, you must be enrolled in both Parts A and B.  You, Medicaid, or another third party must continue to pay your Part B premium.  Another benefit of a Medicare Advantage Plan with Part D coverage is that you only need one Identification card for your hospital, medical, and pharmacy benefits.
    </p><p>
            Medicare Advantage Plans are designed to help you find the right plan at the right price for your own specific needs.  They offer you protection from unexpected medical expenses, with premiums as low as $0.
    </p><p>
            A Medicare Advantage Plan may often use an HMO (Health Maintenance Organization) provider network.  You will have to receive care from an in-network PCP (Primary Care Physician), or other in-network specialist, in order to receive benefits.  You may choose your own PCP from a large selection of PCPs statewide.
    </p><p>
            Keeping the same PCP works best for your care because he or she gets to know you and your health needs when you go in for routine visits and checkups.  Your PCP also maintains a record of your medical history.
    </p><p>
            When you need specialty care, you can count on your PCP to refer you to the right specialists.  The concept of a PCP is central to all HMO plans; however, you can change your PCP at any time for any reason by simply calling the plan provider.
    </p><p>
            If you need emergency or urgent care services, you may go to the nearest health care professional that can help you.  Emergency and urgent care services are covered at the in network rates no matter whether they were received from in-network or out-of network providers.
    </p><p>
            Your Medicare Advantage Plan will have a few enrollment periods you should know about.
    </p><p>
            The Initial Enrollment Period is for the 7 months surrounding your Medicare eligibility: This is the 3 months before you turn 65, the month when you turn 65, and the 3 months after you turn 65.
    </p><p>
            The Annual Election Period usually runs from November 15 to December 31st each year (these dates will change for 2011).  This is the period you can enroll in or change your Medicare Advantage Plan. You may also switch to Original Medicare during the AEP.
    </p><p>
            New coverage begins on January 1st. The Annual Dis-enrollment Period is from January 1 to February 14.  You may dis-enroll from your Medicare Advantage Plan.
    </p><p>
            During this time, you will be enrolled in Original Medicare and will have the option of choosing a stand-alone prescription drug plan.  The Special Enrollment Period varies based on each person's situation.

        <h3>Medicare Supplement</h3>
        <p>
            Medicare Supplement plans are the original form of supplemental insurance for medicare.
        </p><p>
            Medicare Supplement plans are secondary insurance.
    </p><p>
            That means Medicare is billed first, and the remainder of cost is sent through the Medicare Supplement plan for payment. Sometimes they are called Medigap plans.
    </p><p>
            A doctor that accepts medicare must accept any Medicare Supplement plans are the original form of supplemental insurance for medicare.
    </p><p>
            Sometimes they are called medigap plans. Medicare Supplement plans are secondary insurance. That means Medicare is billed first, and the remainder of cost is sent to the Medicare Supplement plan for payment.
    </p><p>
            A doctor that accepts medicare must accept any Medicare Supplement plan. Each year the CMS (the Center for Medicare Services) mandates what will be covered by each option and the for the various Medicare Supplement plans are identified by letters.
    </p><p>
            Once enrolled in one, you will maintain the same benefits as long as you continue to pay the premiums, whether or not the plan is offered to new enrollees.
    </p><p>
            Each year there is a comprehensive option that covers virtually all medical expenses covered by original medicare.  Except during the original open enrollment period, and some special enrollment periods, you must be healthy enough to qualify for a Medicare Supplement plan.
    </p><p>
            These plans do not cover prescription drugs but a stand alone Prescription Drug Plan (PDP) may be purchased.
    </p><p>
            Medicare Supplement plans give you choice and flexibility.
    </p><p>
            You will be responsible for a monthly premium in addition to the monthly part B premium you pay to medicare. There may be some out-of-pocket fees for health care services that are covered, depending on the plan you choose.
    </p><p>
            For some people keeping monthly premiums as low as possible is most important, while others want to save as much as possible on out-of-pocket costs.  Still others want to ensure that they will have emergency medical coverage when they travel outside the United States.
    </p><p>
            The insurance specialists at Boulder Insurance group can help guide you through the choices of Medicare Supplement plans to find the product that is the best fit for your needs.
